    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed and cut into quarters</li>
        <li>2 Â½ tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 large ripe tomato, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 pinches herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 pinch chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>1 pinch chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 pinch chopped fresh thyme</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place 2 pieces of puff pastry onto a silicone-lined baking sheet. Press the short seam of 1 piece onto the other to form the rectangular base of the tart. Cut seams off the other 2 pieces of puff pastry and press them into the edges of the base to act as the border.</li>
        <li>Freeze dough until firm, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Score border with a knife, making shallow cuts 1/4-inch apart. Press the bottom of a fork onto the seam in the middle and poke holes all over the base.</li>
        <li>Bake tart shell until lightly golden and partially puffed, about 10 minutes. Press down on the base using the bottom of a fork. Avoid pressing border. Let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spread mustard over the inside of the tart. Arrange tomato slices into a single layer on top and cut a few slices in half to fill in the gaps. Season with salt and pepper. Generously sprinkle herbes de Provence on top. Add Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and drizzle most of the olive oil on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is well browned and crispy, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature on the baking sheet or transfer to a wire rack using 2 spatulas. Drizzle remaining olive oil over the tart and sprinkle fresh oregano, parsley, and thyme on top.</li>
      </ol>
